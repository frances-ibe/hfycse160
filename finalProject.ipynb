    "## 1 Summary of Research Questions and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This data analysis aimed to explore the interactions between restaurant pricing, household income, and housing cost across different areas in a city. To do so, we focused on the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Our research questions were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Are there any trends across zip code areas concerning restaurant pricing, household income, and housing cost?\n",
    "- We found relatively strong positive correlations between Zillow Home Value Index and mean income, and between mean restaurant price and mean income, Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.774 and 0.677, respectively. Alternatively we found a weak correlation between mean restaurant price and Zillow Home Value Index, Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.242. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Can we predict average restaurant pricing in a zip code area from median house value and average household income?\n",
    "- By fitting two linear regression models to attempt to predict average restaurant price from Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) and mean income, we found that there was no significant linear relationship between these metrics across zip code regions. The R-squared metrics of correlation are: 0.037 and 0.288 for the model between average price and ZHVI and between average price and mean income, respectively.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "##### Does restaurant star rating across price point level vary for different zip code  areas? What are trends in such variance across zip code areas and how does it relate to socioeconomic factors such as median house value and average household income?\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- We found that there are statistically significant difference between restaurant price and rating distribution across zip code regions in Las Vegas. By leveraging this finding we found that for more expensive restaurants (price level 2, 3 and 4) that there is a relatively significant positive correlation between socioeconomics and the prevalence of these restaurants. We also found that there is a negative correlation for cheap restaurants between socioeconomic factors and restaurant prevalence. Furthermore, we proved the statistical difference between price point levels within zip codes and used this finding to draw conclusions on how consumers make spending decisions. \n"

    "## 2 Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer buying power is an important metric used by businesses to represent their ability to succeed at a price point in a given marketplace. Thus, having a proxy for consumer buying power is critical for establishing business success strategies, as well as understanding social and class spending habits. A Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the change in prices consumers pay for a set basket of goods, which is the most commonly used proxy for understanding consumer buying power in a marketplace. However, the CPI lacks the ability to distinguish subtle differences in buying power of consumers of varying socioeconomic classes. Hence, our project seeks to understand how consumers of higher socioeconomic classes versus lower socioeconomic classes rate goods at a certain price point. Our project uses food from restaurants as a proxy for a basket of goods, which limits this analysis to restaurant consumer buying power. However, restaurants are included as one of the goods in the basket that is used to establish the overall CPI, so our analysis is useful when combined with the sub CPI specific to restaurants. For analyzing economic class, we used a predicted median housing price index (Zestimate) and mean income from IRS tax returns as proxies. This analysis provides insight into how consumers view purchasing of goods at certain price points based on the socioeconomic standing within a zip code of interest. This analysis is especially useful in combination with the CPI in estimating whether a business has the ability to succeed in a marketplace at a given price point. This analysis is useful to restaurant owners in the in Las Vegas, Nevada as it provides market insight for restaurants in a per zip code manner."
