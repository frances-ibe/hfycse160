"** - Not shown to avoid disclosure of information 
about specific taxpayers.  However, the data are 
combined with data in an adjacent size class, 
as appropriate, and included in the appropriate totals."																																																																																																																																																
"[1] The ZIP Code is based on the 5-digit ZIP code on the individual 
income tax return.  ZIP Codes with less than 100 returns, 
identified as a single building ZIP code, or identified as a 
nonresidential ZIP code have been categorized as other (99999)."																																																																																																																																																
"[2] The ""Number of volunteer prepared returns"" shows counts of 
returns prepared by IRS-certified volunteers to taxpayers with 
limited income, persons with disabilities, limited English speaking 
taxpayers, current and former members of the military, and 
taxpayers who are 60 years of age and older."																																																																																																																																																
[3] Includes primary taxpayers 60 years of age or older.																																																																																																																																																
[4] Less deficit.																																																																																																																																																
"[5] ""Qualified dividends"" are ordinary dividends received 
in tax years beginning after 2002 that meet certain 
conditions and receive preferential tax rates. 
The maximum qualified dividends tax rate is 20%."																																																																																																																																																
"[6] Includes the Alaskan permanent fund, reported by 
residents of Alaska on Forms 1040A and 1040EZ's.  
This fund only applies to statistics in the totals, and the 
state of Alaska."																																																																																																																																																
"[7] ""Earned income credit"" includes both the refundable 
and non-refundable portions.  The non-refundable portion 
could reduce income tax and certain related taxes to zero. 
The earned income credit amounts in excess of total tax 
liability, or amounts when there was no tax liability at all, 
were refundable.  See footnote 8 below for explanation 
of the refundable portion of the earned income credit."																																																																																																																																																
"[8] The refundable portion of the ""earned income credit"" 
equals ""total income tax"" minus the ""earned income credit.""  
If the result is negative, this amount is considered the 
refundable portion.  No other refundable credits were 
taken into account for this calculation."																																																																																																																																																
"[9]  ""Income tax"" reflects the amount reported on 
Form 1040 line 56.  It also includes data from 
Form 1040A and 1040EZ filers.  "																																																																																																																																																
"[10] ""Total tax liability"" differs from ""Income tax,"" in that
""Total tax liability"" includes the taxes from recapture of 
certain prior-year credits, tax applicable to individual 
retirement arrangements (IRA's), social security taxes 
on self-employment income and on certain tip income, 
advanced earned income payments, household
employment taxes, and certain ""other taxes"" listed 
in the Form 1040 instructions."																																																																																																																																																
"[11] Reflects payments to or withholdings made to 
""Total tax liability"".  This is the amount the tax filer 
owes when the income tax return is filed."																																																																																																																																																
"[12]  The amount of overpayments the tax filer requested to 
have refunded. "																																																																																																																																																
"NOTE: This table presents aggregates of all returns filed and
processed through the Individual Master File (IMF) system 
during Calendar Year 2017, including any returns filed for 
tax years preceding 2016."																																																																																																																																																
"This table is based on tax returns as initially processed by IRS
and does not reflect amended returns or errors that were
corrected after initial processing. In general, during administrative 
or Master File processing, taxpayer reporting discrepancies are 
corrected only to the extent necessary. The statistics in the ZIP code 
data should, therefore, be used with the knowledge that some of the 
data have not been perfected or edited for statistical purposes 
and that State totals in this table may not be altogether 
comparable to other State totals published by the IRS,
